# Portfolio Website

This is my portfolio website to demonstrate the projects I've created or worked on, as well as the skills I've learned as I progress through Codecademy's Full-Stack Engineer career path.

It, like the projects it demonstrates, utilises HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It has also been versioned using Git.
